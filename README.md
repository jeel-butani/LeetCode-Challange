# 🚀 LeetCode Challange🚀

## 1. Understand the Problem 🧐

Read the problem statement carefully. 📖<br>
Make sure you understand the problem requirements and constraints. 💡<br>
Identify the input and output format. 📝<br>
Clarify any doubts or ambiguities in the problem statement. 🤔<br>

## 2. Example Test Cases 🧪

Look for example test cases provided in the problem description. 📚<br>
Understand the expected input and output for these examples. 👀<br>
Try solving the problem manually for these examples to gain insight. 🛠<br>

## 3. Plan Your Approach 🗺

Determine the most appropriate data structures and algorithms for the problem. 📊<br>
Break down the problem into smaller subproblems if necessary. 🧩<br>
Sketch a high-level algorithm or pseudocode to guide your implementation. 📝<br>

## 4. Write Code ✍️

Start writing your code based on the plan you've devised. 🖋️<br>
Pay attention to coding conventions, naming, and readability. 📜<br>
Implement the solution incrementally if the problem is complex, testing each part as you go. 🛠<br>

## 5. Edge Cases and Corner Cases 🤯

Consider edge cases and corner cases (e.g., empty input, minimum/maximum values) and ensure your code handles them correctly. 🧐

## 6. Test Your Code 🧪

Test your solution with both the provided test cases and additional test cases you come up with. 🧪<br>
Pay attention to correctness, efficiency, and potential off-by-one errors. 🕵️<br>
Debug and fix any issues you encounter. 🐞 <br>

## 7. Optimize and Refactor 🚀

If your code is working but you want to improve its efficiency, analyze your algorithm and data structures for possible optimizations. 🚀<br>
Refactor your code for clarity, readability, and to remove redundant or unnecessary code. 📎 <br>

## 8. Submit and Discuss 📬

Once you are confident in your solution, submit it on LeetCode for evaluation. 🚀 <br>
Study the editorial or other solutions if you face difficulties or want to learn different approaches. 📚 <br>

## 9. Learn and Iterate 🔄

Regardless of the outcome, review the solutions of others and learn from them. 🧠 <br>
Iterate on the problem if you think there's room for improvement. 🔄 <br>

## 10. Time and Space Complexity ⏰

Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution. This is important for understanding the efficiency of your code. ⏰<br>

## 11. Keep Practicing 🏋️

Regularly practice by solving more LeetCode problems. The more you practice, the better you'll become at problem-solving and coding. 🏋️ <br>

## 12. Stay Persistent 💪

Don't get discouraged if you find problems challenging. Keep trying, and your problem-solving skills will improve over time. 💪 <br>
