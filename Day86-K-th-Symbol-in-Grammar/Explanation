779. K-th Symbol in Grammar

Problem: This code is designed to find the value at the K-th position in a specific sequence, following a set of rules.

Approach: It uses a recursive function that works as follows:

~ If n (a parameter) is 1, it returns 0.
~ If k is even, it calls itself with n-1 and k/2. If the result is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns 0.
~ If k is odd, it calls itself with n-1 and (k+1)/2. If the result is 0, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns 1.
  
Complexity:

Time complexity: O(log K) because the problem size decreases by half in each recursive call.
Space complexity: O(log K) due to the recursive function calls.
